To open the .ipynb file you will need to upload it to Google Colab.
Also in the folder is the dataset that is used in this lab. (Same dataset as Lab 2)
The dataset will also have to be uploaded into Google Colab. (Have to repeat set every 24 hours)

The result that I was able to get using a SVM was 93% which is better then the 89% that I was getting using a perceptron model.
